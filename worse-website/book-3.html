    <p><b>Those Wild Wyndhams: Three Sisters at the Heart of Power by Claudia Renton</b></p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>Our author, Claudia, seems to lack a website of her own (I totally get it) but her publisher <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/246524/those-wild-wyndhams-by-claudia-renton/">Penguin Random House</a> provided a solid description:
      <br><br><i>"They were confidantes to British prime ministers, poets, writers, and artists, their lives entwined with the most celebrated and scandalous figures of the day, from Oscar Wilde to Henry James. They were the lovers of great men—or men of great prominence…Mary Wyndham, wilder than her wild brothers; lover of Wilfrid Blunt, confidante of Prime Minister Arthur Balfour (the Balfour Declaration); married to Hugo, Lord Elcho; later the Countess of Wemyss…Madeline Adeane, the quietest and happiest of the three…and Pamela, spoiled, beautiful, of the three, possesser of the true talent, wife of the Foreign Secretary Edward Grey (later Viscount Grey), who took Britain into the First World War. They lived in a world of luxurious excess, a world of splendor at 44 Belgrave Square, and later at the even more vast Clouds, the exquisite Wiltshire house on 4,000 acres, the “house of the age,” designed, in 1876, by the visionary architect, Philip Webb; the model for Henry James's The Spoils of Poynton. They were bred with the pride of the Plantagenets and raised with a fierce belief that their family was exceptional. They avoided the norm at all costs and led the way to a blending of aristocracy and art. Their group came to be called The Souls, whose members from 1885 to the 1920s included the most distinguished politicians, artists, and thinkers of their time."</i>

    <p>I love learning about the Gilded Age and the grossly conspicuous consumption of its era. The women of that day particularly interest me as they were typically in the shadows of their robber baron husbands.<br><br>This book focuses on one such family of women, sisters known for their well-positioned marriages but also their sometimes-dramatic relationships, influence in society, and accomplishments.</p>

    <ul><br>
      <li><b>What made me want to read it:</b> Who wouldn't want to read about a trio of chic, sassy sisters of yesteryear?</li>
      <li><b>What page did I pause on:</b> 117</li>
      <li><b>What I think about it so far:</b>You can tell I was more into this one than the others because it is the farthest book I've gotten into. And it's quite enjoyable! But I do recommend skimming past any mention of mundane rich, white people activities. Why bother.</li>  
      <li><b>Where you can find and attempt to try reading it, too:</b> <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/those-wild-wyndhams-three-sisters-at-the-heart-of-power-claudia-renton/8571805?ean=9781101872567">Bookshop.org</a></li><br>
