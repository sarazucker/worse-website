    <p><b>The House of Fragile Things: Jewish Art Collectors and the Fall of France by James McAuley</b></p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>Since my website was created specifically because this book sits unfinished, I'll let the <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300264692/the-house-of-fragile-things/">Yale University Press</a> tease you about James' book since his website may be as terrible as my own:
      <br><br><i>"In the dramatic years between 1870 and the end of World War II, a number of prominent French Jews—pillars of an embattled community—invested their fortunes in France's cultural artifacts, sacrificed their sons to the country's army, and were ultimately rewarded by seeing their collections plundered and their families deported to Nazi concentration camps.
      <br><br>In this rich, evocative account, James McAuley explores the central role that art and material culture played in the assimilation and identity of French Jews in thefin de siècle. Weaving together narratives of various figures, some familiar from the works of Marcel Proust and the diaries of Jules and Edmond Goncourt—the Camondos, the Rothschilds, the Ephrussis, the Cahens d'Anvers—McAuley shows how Jewish art collectors contended with a powerful strain of anti-Semitism: they were often accused of “invading” France's cultural patrimony. The collections these families left behind—many ultimately donated to the French state—were their response, tragic attempts to celebrate a nation that later betrayed them."</i>

    <p>While I continue to treat this site like a blog, I'll continue to write in a similar tone by admitting something to you...<br><br>Non-fiction hurts my brain.<br><br>That's a bold statement but I typically have to read a non-fiction book twice in order for it to truly sink in. Thousands of books fit that genre...thousands of books that will continue to sit half-read by me.

      <ul><br>
      <li><b>What made me want to read it:</b> Though I do not have French lineage, the discourse around stolen art from wealthy families during the Holocaust is interesting to me.</li>
      <li><b>What page did I pause on:</b> 91</li>
      <li><b>What I think about it so far:</b> Facts are heavy, particularly facts about World War II-related discourse, but because I am endlessly fascinated by pronvenance, I've enjoyed the book thus far</li>  
      <li><b>Where you can find and attempt to try reading it, too:</b> <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-house-of-fragile-things-jewish-art-collectors-and-the-fall-of-france/18863715?ean=9780300264692">Bookshop.org</a></li><br>
