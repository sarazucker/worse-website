   <h2>Enemy #1: A Traveling Psychic</h2>
   <div class="bookList">
       <p><b>The Immortalists: A Novel by Chloe Benjamin</b></p>
   </div>
   <div>
   <p>Because I haven't finished reading this book, I cannot provide an adequate description so I've employed <a href="https://www.chloebenjaminbooks.com/the-immortalists">the author</a> to do that part for me:
      <br><br><i>"It's 1969 in New York City's Lower East Side, and word has spread of the arrival of a mystical woman, a traveling psychic who claims to be able to tell anyone the day they will die. The Gold children—four adolescents on the cusp of self-awareness—sneak out to hear their fortunes.
      <br><br>The prophecies inform their next five decades. Golden-boy Simon escapes to the West Coast, searching for love in '80s San Francisco; dreamy Klara becomes a Las Vegas magician, obsessed with blurring reality and fantasy; eldest son Daniel seeks security as an army doctor post-9/11, hoping to control fate; and bookish Varya throws herself into longevity research, where she tests the boundary between science and immortality.
      <br><br>A sweeping novel of remarkable ambition and depth, The Immortalists probes the line between destiny and choice, reality and illusion, this world and the next. It is a deeply moving testament to the power of story, the nature of belief, and the unrelenting pull of familial bonds."</i>

   <p>Why did I not finish this beautiful book?<br><br>Allow me to explain myself, albeit poorly. It's shameful, but I barely started it and, despite that eye-catching cover teasing me every morning when I wake up, seeing it on the nightstand next to my bed, I haven't gotten beyond the Chapter 1.<br><br>Please don't tell Chloe.</p>
   </div>
      <ul><br>
      <li><b>What made me want to read it:</b> Reviews sang endless praise and with a prompt like "If you knew the date of your death, how would you live your life?" how could I resist?</li>
      <li><b>What page did I pause on:</b> 9</li>
      <li><b>What I think about it so far:</b> Very little. I literally stopped reading on page 9.<br>If you asked me about what's happened in the previous eight pages, I wouldn't be able to tell you.</li>  
      <li><b>Where you can find and attempt to try reading it, too:</b> <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-immortalists-chloe-benjamin/9582519?ean=9780735215092">Bookshop.org</a></li><br>
