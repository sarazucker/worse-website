   <p>Thanks to INFO-654, this website will live as a reminder of my laziness. Hopefully, for a limited time.<br><br>It is the result of many years of accumulating spectacular prose with beautiful, eye-catching covers and sparkling reviews...and then allowing them to sit unread on my shelves for some poor excuse or another. Know that they are all best-selling books for a reason, but I'm not ashamed to admit that I currently <i>~*lack the brainspace*~</i> if you know what I mean.
      <br><br>My site highlights a small part of this ever-growing tower and I look forward to telling you equally as little about them.
      <br><br>(You should also know that this is only 1 of at least 6 other piles of books in my apartment.)
